# TP3-Test_TDD 
Following the methodology TDD (Test Driven Development) to apply The Art of Coding Through Testing :
  - Writing the expected behavior before writing the test (Sometimes reveals inconsistencies, even before you code!)
  - Building the application code so that it is easily testable.
  - Objectives :
    - Adapting the code to the tests (and not the other way around!).
    - Writing a unit test.
    - Step-by-step construction

Firstly coded a game called Fizz buzz used to teach multiplication tables to children. Each player counts one in one, one after the other, but every time you have to say a
number divisible by 3 we say "fizz" instead, and each time we have to say a number divisible by 5 is announced: "Buzz".
Then developed a class that returns welcome messages, according to a string passed as a parameter describing the people to be commended but with new challenges for each new name.
